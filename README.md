# blast-radius-docs

Examples and expanded documentation for *[Blast Radius](https://github.com/28mm/blast-radius)*, a tool for reasoning about *[Terraform](https://terraform.io)* dependency graphs with interactive visualizations.

 * Visit the [live site](https://28mm.github.io/blast-radius-docs).
 * Site Generation scripts not included in this distribution (request if desired).

### Limitations

Functionality is reduced compared with a local instance of *Blast Radius* owing to the static nature of GitHub pages. For instance:

 * prune-to-selection is not available.
 * module-depth is not available.
 * mobile support is dubious at best.

### Contributing

 * Further examples, beyond those included with terraform-providers-* distributions, are strongly desired. Please open an issue to make a suggestion, or contact me directly: <patrick.mcmurchie@gmail.com>.
 * Please open issues to report ui glitches, and other bugs.
